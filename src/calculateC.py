    Parameters
    ----------
    alphabet : str
        DNA or Protein.
    Q : np.array
        The symmetric rate matrix Q scaled such that the average substitution 
        rate is 1.
    d : float
        Branch length.
    
    Returns
    -------
    cost_matrix : double dict
        Specifies the cost for each character pair.
    average_cost: float
        The average cost which is used to calculate gap penalties.
